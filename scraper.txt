As you can see in the Inspector, you will see a fraction of the websites source code, and a line will be
pre-highlighted. Now there are many ways we can interact with the element. We could use the “id”, or
the “class” name. To keep things simple i suggest you right click on the highlighted line and
click “Copy Unique Selector”, this will copy what is called the “css selector”.We will use this to interact
with the webpage in our code.

I won’t go in too much depth with this but the reason i like to use “css selector” instead of id and
class names is because sometimes id’s and class names force you to have to climb through the source code.
Such as having to open “classname#1” then open “classname#2”. In situations like this the “copy css selector”
will have already climbed down the source code for us. This is why i suggest to use css selector, it’s just easier.

Next do the same for the password field, and the login button.

The username field’s css selector is      #email

The Password field’s css selector is       #pass

The Login Button’s css selector is         #u_0_q

Okay Now let’s hop into Pycharm and create a skeleton for our code!

from selenium import webdriver  ##Imports the selenium web driver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()    ##Create a Firefox Webdriver
driver.get("https://www.facebook.com/")  ##Tells the driver to go to facebook.com
Next we need to actually enter in our username and password, then click the login button.

driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#email").send_keys("insert username here")
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#pass").send_keys("insert password here")
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#u_0_q").click()
Now let’s pick this apart.

driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#email") ##This finds the css selector #email
.send_keys("insert username here") ##this will send the text to the found element
.click()  ## Pretty self explanatory, this will click on the found element

And that’s it ! A simple Facebook login!

from selenium import webdriver  ##Imports the selenium web driver
driver = webdriver.Firefox()    ##Create a Firefox Webdriver
driver.get("https://www.facebook.com/")  ##Tells the driver to go to facebook.com
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#email").send_keys("insert username here")
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#pass").send_keys("insert password here")
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#u_0_q").click()
If you happen to have any troubles try using time.sleep() between each line such as below.
This is because sometimes selenium may move too fast for the browser to keep up.

from selenium import webdriver ##Imports the selenium web driver
driver = webdriver.Firefox() ##Create a Firefox Webdriver
driver.get("https://www.facebook.com/") ##Tells the driver to go to facebook.com
import time
time.sleep(1) ##waits for 1 second
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#email").send_keys("insert username here")
time.sleep(1)
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#pass").send_keys("insert password here")
time.sleep(1)
driver.find_element_by_css_selector("#u_0_q").click()
